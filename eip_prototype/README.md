## Implementation of a draft of an EIP for Rental NFTs with Rights Management


<br>

Please refer to [this link](eip-9999.md) for the proposal (solution), which follows the guidelines from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs).

A reference implementation (in [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)) can be found [here](eip-9999-test/).


Finally, you can check that the EIP is well-formatted by running EF's EIP validator locally:

```shell
> cargo install eipv
> eipv

draft: 1, review: 0, last_call: 0, final: 0, stagnant: 0, withdrawn: 0, living: 0
valid: 1, invalid: 0
```
